`dart-list` displays a virtual, 'infinite' list. The template inside the
`dart-list` element represents the dom to create for each list item. The
`data` property specifies an array of list item data. The `height` property
represents the height of a list item.

By default, the list supports selection via tapping. Styling the selection
should be done via binding. The `selectedProperty` property is set on the
list view data for each selected item.

`dart-list` manages a viewport of data based on the current scroll position.
For performance reasons, not every item in the list is rendered at once.
